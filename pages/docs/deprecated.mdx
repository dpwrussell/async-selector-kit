## useDispatch(dispatcher: Function, id?: string): void **_ Deprecated _**

This function gives the package the ability to dispatch actions. Not calling useDispatch() will cause an error to be thrown. If you would like to pass a dispatch function to a specific async selector, you can use the optional id parameter.

### Example

```js
import { combineReducers, createStore } from "redux";
import { useDispatch, createReducer } from "async-selector-kit";
import _ from "underscore";

const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  // Your other sub-reducers go here ...
  AsyncSelector: createReducer(),
});

export const store = createStore(rootReducer);
// This trick may be useful in some apps.
// This will prevent re-render events from firing to close together causing over-rendering
const throttledDispatch = _.throttle(store.dispatch, 50);
useDispatch(throttledDispatch);
```
