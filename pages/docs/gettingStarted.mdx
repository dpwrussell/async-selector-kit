# Getting Started

## Installation

We're going to assume you have redux already installed and working in your Application.

```sh
yarn add async-selector-kit
```

## Connect to Redux

Before creating new async selectors, you must do two things. You must provide a reference to a dispatch function so re-render actions can be generated. You must have your reducer handle these actions.

```js
import { combineReducers, createStore, applyMiddleware } from "redux";
import { createMiddleware, createReducer } from "async-selector-kit";

const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  // Your other sub-reducers go here ...
  AsyncSelector: createReducer(),
});

const middlewares = [
  // your other middleware goes here ...
  createMiddleware(),
];

export const store = createStore(rootReducer, applyMiddleware(...middlewares));
```

## Basic Example

With that set up, you can start creating async selectors. Here is basic example:

```js
import { createAsyncSelectorResults } from "async-selector-kit";

// Your real request code goes here. This is just for example.
const getEmployees = (searchText) => {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    const database = ["Mark Metzger", "Steve Miller"];
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve(database.filter((name) => searchText.includes(name)));
    }, 1000);
  });
};

const [employees, isLoading, error] = createAsyncSelectorResults(
  {
    async: getEmployees,
    id: "myFirstAsyncSelector",
    defaultValue: [],
  },
  [(state) => state.searchText]
);

// employees(state) returns the last value returned from the async function or the defaultValue if it has not yet successfully returned a value
// isLoading(state) return a boolean for if the async function is pending
// error(state) returns the error created by async function or null if there was no error
```
