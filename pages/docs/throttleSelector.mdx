## throttleSelector(selector, throttler, id?): selector

This function is slightly different from createThrottledSelector and is useful for when you need both the original selector and a throttled version of it. For example you might want to do an expensive calculation after the user is done typing but you don't want to make the textfield rendering debounced.

### Example

```js
import { throttleSelector } from "async-selector-kit";
import _ from "underscore";
import { createSelector } from "reselect";

function expensiveFunction(text) {
  for (let i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
    text += text;
  }
  return text;
}

// This selector can be used by the textfield component
const getText = (state) => state.searchText;

const throttledText = throttleSelector(
  getText,
  (f) => _.debounce(f, 250),
  "getText"
);

// This selector will only re-compute if the user hasn't typed for 250ms.
const text10000 = createSelector([throttledText], expensiveFunction);
```
