## createReducer(): (state = {}, action) => state

This a very simple function which returns a sub-reducer designed to be used in conjunction with combineReducers(). You don't have to use this function. You are free to handle the re-render actions generated by the library however you choose. The only requirement is that your reducer should alway return a reference to a new state or else the app will not correctly re-render. It also strongly discouraged to access any data in the re-render actions as the async selectors should represent the "single source of truth".

### Example

```js
import { combineReducers } from "redux";
import { createReducer } from "async-selector-kit";

const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  // Your other sub-reducers go here ...
  AsyncSelector: createReducer(),
});
```

Alternatively, an example without using createReducer():

```js
import { combineReducers } from "redux";
import { PROMISE_RESOLVED, PROMISE_REJECTED } from "async-selector-kit";

const subReducers = combineReducers({
  // Your sub-reducers go here ...
});

const rootReducer = (state, action) => {
  if (action.type === PROMISE_RESOLVED || action.type === PROMISE_REJECTED) {
    return { ...state };
  }
  return subReducers(state, action);
};
```

An example showing how you can log errors generated async selectors.

```js
import { PROMISE_REJECTED } from "redux-starter-kit";

const loggerMiddleware = (store) => (next) => (action) => {
  let result = next(action);
  if (action.type === PROMISE_REJECTED) {
    // Alternatively, you could show the error to the user by dispatching another action, or send the actions to a DB.
    console.log(action.error);
  }
  return result;
};
```
